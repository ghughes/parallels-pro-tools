## Admin tools for Parallels Pro Control Panel for Linux 10.3.3

These are some Python scripts I wrote to assist with administration of one of our servers at work. They serve a very specific purpose (we used them whilst migrating a bunch of sites off the server), although you may find some use for them too. They must be run as root.

### email_audit.py

Lists mailboxes, aliases and current MX servers (according to DNS) for each domain hosted on the server.

### site_audit.py

Generates a CSV file listing every site hosted on the server, along with some stats:
* whether the site is enabled
* how much bandwidth the site has used this cycle
* maximum bandwidth allowed
* whether Webalizer or AWStats are turned on
* number of email accounts and MySQL databases
